## Introduction

This repository consists of two parts, the first is a step-by-step guide on how to setup and install Worldgroup and MajorMUD; the second is a set of PHP scripts aimed at giving the Sysop direct access to Worldgroup's and MajorMUD's Btrieve databases.

## Operating System

While selecting an operating system (OS) use to make a huge difference and many people would only recommend something such as Windows XP. Nowadays things have changed drastically and you should **by no means** run an older OS unless specifically necessary. There are too many secondary security concerns when opening an older OS up to the internet which will not be covered here.

That said, you may choose Windows 10 or Windows 11. For future proof reasons this guide will be under the assumption that you have chosen Windows 11[^1].

[^1]: If you need assistance setting up Windows 11, reference [kyaulabs/win11tweak](https://github.com/kyaulabs/win11tweak)

## Installation

## Btrieve

Btrieve (pronounced `bee-treev`) is a relational database management system (RDBMS). While not in use much anymore, Btrieve was known for its low-level, efficient and lightweight database engine.

Btrieve is used for Worldgroup and MajorMUD for both of their internal databases.
